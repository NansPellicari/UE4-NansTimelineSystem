## 2. Design decisions

My goal was to create the most extensible plugin as possible and keep things simple and readable as inspired by [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) philosophy and [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID).

<a id="markdown-21-core--ue4-separation" name="21-core--ue4-separation"></a>

### 2.1. Core & UE4 separation

**> Core** module manage every "basic" functionnalities:

-   it manipulates basics data
-   it is a lightweight library with the less dependencies as possible (only **Core** UE4 modules)
-   it provides basics interfaces or abstract classes to work with
-   it can be build for simple project as **program** build instead of **game** build (to run fast unit tests for example, see [UE4-TPL-CppWithTestEnv](https://github.com/NansPellicari/UE4-TPL-CppWithTestEnv) for an "how to")

**> UE4** module is a more high level paradigm:

-   it is the bridge from **Core** library to **UE4 Editor** and **Game** program
-   it provides more complex implementations of **Core** interfaces or abstract classes thanks to a bunch of [decorators](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator) to fit with general **game needs**.
-   it provides **configs** & **UI** (blueprints) for editor manipulations
-   it manages **serialization** for the whole system
-   it provides an interface for your **GameInstance** to work with the [TimelineClient](../Source/NansTimelineSystemUE4/Public/TimelineClient.h) object, this makes the glue with configurations, blueprint functions and serialization for savegame.

## 3. How to override, create my own Event, Timeline, etc...

First, I create the whole structure to be the most extensible.  
To doing it, we have to consider **3** basics elements:

![basic class](./mermaid/basic-class.png)

> To get more details, you can read the [README definitions](../README.md#3-definitions) section.

Each of these **Core** classes in `Source/NansTimelineSystemCore` have their **decorator(s)** in the `Source/NansTimelineSystemUE4`.  
The most preferable way to extend it, it's to create you own decorator or override existants decorators.

<a id="markdown-31-timelinemanager" name="31-timelinemanager"></a>

### 3.1. TimelineManager

It can be easily decorated, see [Source/NansTimelineSystemUE4/Public/Manager/\*](../Source/NansTimelineSystemUE4/Public/Manager/) for examples.  
The easy way is to override the base decorator [TimelineManagerBaseDecorator](../Source/NansTimelineSystemUE4/Public/Manager/TimelineManagerBaseDecorator.h).  
You can create your own manager for your game specificities.

<a id="markdown-32-timeline" name="32-timeline"></a>

### 3.2. Timeline

This class and it's decorator should not be overrided, they provide the basic functionnalities to manage events and serialization, they work more as extended queues rather than client object with complex usage.

<a id="markdown-33-timelinemanagerevent" name="33-timelinemanagerevent"></a>

### 3.3. TimelineEvent

You **should** create decorator for it, the best way its to extend the [TimelineEventDecorator](../Source/NansTimelineSystemUE4/Public/Event/TimelineEventDecorator.h) class.  
You can create a **blueprint** child based on it or a **c++** override.

> To make your data saveable, don't forget to use `UPROPERTY(SaveGame)` in your dedicated fields,  
> or in your blueprint details panel:

<a id="markdown-4-special-case-load-game" name="4-special-case-load-game"></a>

## 4. Special case: Load game

**Load** is a bit tricky here, because we need to pass a `UWorld` object to the `USaveGame` object to retrieve `UNTimelineManager` from the `UGameInstance`.  
As I explain [here](https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/958879/what-is-the-best-way-to-populate-usavegame-on-load.html) the actual code (UE4.25) doesn't allow it with the standard approach.

<a id="markdown-41-create-usavegame-object" name="41-create-usavegame-object"></a>

### 4.1. Create USaveGame Object

Fist you can follow [this UE4 doc page](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Gameplay/SaveGame/index.html) to create your own.
Then you have to add a public `UObject* WorldContextObject` property and add these lines:

```cpp
// in the top of file in the includes part
#include "NansTimelineSystemUE4/Public/TimelineGameInstance.h"
// in your `Serialize()` method
if (WorldContextObject == nullptr) return;
if (WorldContextObject->GetWorld() == nullptr) return;
if (WorldContextObject->GetWorld()->GetGameInstance() == nullptr) return;

// To retrieve the c++ layer of the interface
INTimelineGameInstance* GI = Cast<INTimelineGameInstance>(WorldContextObject->GetWorld()->GetGameInstance());
if (GI == nullptr) return;

GI->GetClient()->Serialize(Ar);
```

### 4.2. Copy/Paste to override UE functions

> /!\ Important note:  
> Due to UE4 license limitation, I can't copy/paste too much engine's code here.  
> I'll try to give you the most clues as possible to do it on your own.

All the concerns part are located in the [UGameplayStatics](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/42d84f7d1f9c2147ad109179f268fd1542b2ccd2/Engine/Source/Runtime/Engine/Private/GameplayStatics.cpp) class.

So first you need to create a custom `UBlueprintFunctionLibrary` and copy/paste [UGameplayStatics::LoadGameFromMemory()](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/42d84f7d1f9c2147ad109179f268fd1542b2ccd2/Engine/Source/Runtime/Engine/Private/GameplayStatics.cpp#L2077) and [UGameplayStatics::LoadGameFromSlot()](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/42d84f7d1f9c2147ad109179f268fd1542b2ccd2/Engine/Source/Runtime/Engine/Private/GameplayStatics.cpp#L2150) on your project side.

-   `LoadGameFromSlot()` is the blueprint function you will call on the editor side. In its declaration, you need to add a WorldContext Parameter:

```cpp
// In .h file
UFUNCTION(..., meta = (WorldContext = "WorldContextObject",...))
... LoadGameFromSlot(UObject* WorldContext,...);
// In .cpp file you need to call your LoadGameFromMemory() with this object as parameter
LoadGameFromMemory(...,WorldContext WorldContextObject);
```

-   `LoadGameFromMemory()` is the c++ function that `LoadGameFromSlot()` should call and this is where you can add the world to the `USaveGame` object. Just between the [USaveGame instanciation](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/42d84f7d1f9c2147ad109179f268fd1542b2ccd2/Engine/Source/Runtime/Engine/Private/GameplayStatics.cpp#L2102) and the call of [Serialize()](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/42d84f7d1f9c2147ad109179f268fd1542b2ccd2/Engine/Source/Runtime/Engine/Private/GameplayStatics.cpp#L2105) method you need to add:

```cpp
// USaveGame instanciation
OutSaveGameObject->WorldContextObject = WorldContextObject;
// USaveGame::Serialize() call
```

And because life is not so easy, unfortunatly you have to copy/paste and include other dependencies...

First in your cpp header:

```cpp
#include "Misc/EngineVersion.h"
#include "Runtime/Engine/Classes/Kismet/GameplayStatics.h"
#include "Serialization/ObjectAndNameAsStringProxyArchive.h"
```

and from the [UGameplayStatics](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/42d84f7d1f9c2147ad109179f268fd1542b2ccd2/Engine/Source/Runtime/Engine/Private/GameplayStatics.cpp) you have to copy:

-   the static var [UE4_SAVEGAME_FILE_TYPE_TAG](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/42d84f7d1f9c2147ad109179f268fd1542b2ccd2/Engine/Source/Runtime/Engine/Private/GameplayStatics.cpp#L52)
-   the full struct [FSaveGameFileVersion](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/42d84f7d1f9c2147ad109179f268fd1542b2ccd2/Engine/Source/Runtime/Engine/Private/GameplayStatics.cpp#L75)

In [this post](https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/958879/what-is-the-best-way-to-populate-usavegame-on-load.html) I've suggested 2 ways to simplify this process, but I still don't have any response.

### 4.3. Trigger Save/Load

Now you can use you special function to load game:

![save & load](./img/save-load.png)
