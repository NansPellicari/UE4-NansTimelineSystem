# Nans Timeline system

This plugins allows to keep tracks of time for different timeline paradigm<sup>(1)</sup>, attached events<sup>(2)</sup> to them and managed serialization for Save and Load game.

> <sup>1</sup> [Real life](#331---real-life) time, [Game life](#332---game-life) and [Level life](#333---level-life)  
> <sup>2</sup> Light `UObject` carrying data and/or simple functionnalities you design

![Nans Timeline System](./Docs/img/intro.png)

> Note:  
> I've hesitated at first to use the word **"Timeline"** which is already used in the UE4 paradigm for animation (see [this](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Timelines/index.html)).  
> The thing is, it's the most accurate word for the feature this plugin provides,
> so I still decided to use it but for BP I prefixed with **Nans** (= **NansTimeline**) everywhere to avoid confusion.

## 1. Requirements

<a id="markdown-11-ue4-plugins" name="11-ue4-plugins"></a>

### 1.1. UE4 plugins

-   [NansUE4TestsHelpers](https://github.com/NansPellicari/UE4-TestsHelpers) (free UE4 plugins)
-   [NansCoreHelpers](https://github.com/NansPellicari/UE4-CoreHelpers) (free UE4 plugins)

<a id="markdown-2-usages" name="2-usages"></a>

## 2. Usages

I use this for differents purposes.  
First I created this to manage a **bonus/malus** system cause I needed to centralized their life duration.  
Then I realized that it can be very helpfull for **different purposes** in my game as creating **promotionnal content**, **bonus/malus**, **temporary skills**, **xp earning factors**, ... with a limited time and having **precise stats** for **player activities**.

<a id="markdown-3-definitions" name="3-definitions"></a>

## 3. Definitions

<a id="markdown-31-timeline" name="31-timeline"></a>

### 3.1. Timeline

A timeline is a simple **queue of events** which is dedicated to store (to keep traces for stats) and notify them (depending on their parameters and timeline paradigm) on their lifetime events: start & time increase.  
As a client, you should never have to use it.

<a id="markdown-32-timeline-manager" name="32-timeline-manager"></a>

### 3.2. Timeline manager

Is working as a remote control for **Timeline**, it controls time state (Play, Pause) and stream (tick interval, slow motion, ...).  
As a client, it is your main interface.

<a id="markdown-33-timeline-manager-types" name="33-timeline-manager-types"></a>

### 3.3. Timeline manager types

<a id="markdown-331---real-life" name="331---real-life"></a>

#### 3.3.1. - Real Life

The intent of the **Real Life** timeline is to tracks times **since** the **first start of the game**.  
It is **not affected** by **time alterations** such as **play/pause** and **slow motion**.  
After the game stops, it shoulds **replay** all the **missing time** on game reloading to **update** attached **Events states**.  
As real life is, its state is always **Play**.  
Be careful when you attached events, it could increase memory if they have undeterminate life time.

<a id="markdown-332---game-life" name="332---game-life"></a>

#### 3.3.2. - Game Life

It keeps track of player game session. It follows the same stream, **Play/Pause**, **Stop**, **slow motion**, ...  
After the game stops, it shoulds restart at the exact same time as the last session.  
Be careful too when you attached event here.

<a id="markdown-333---level-life" name="333---level-life"></a>

#### 3.3.3. - Level Life

The same as [Game Life](#2--game-life) but it is reinitialized when level changes.  
You can be less worried on attaching event here, but be aware that all events are definitively removed on reinitialization (level changes).

<a id="markdown-334---and-" name="334---and-"></a>

#### 3.3.4. - And ...

You can easily create your own timeline manager. See [Developers docs](./Docs/Developers.md).

<a id="markdown-34-event" name="34-event"></a>

### 3.4. Event

It is intended to be the most extensible as possible.  
So in its actual state, it is just a base class which embeds the necessary data to managed its lifetime.  
You can specialized it with only a simple inherited **Blueprint** or in **c++ classes** (creating a [Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)) to do what your want.  
To get some examples:

-   I create a **scheduled event** to **trigger a message** to motivate the player when it cumulates an amount of succeeded actions during a determinate range of time.
-   In combination with my [Factors Factory System](https://github.com/NansPellicari/UE4-FactorsFactory) and **Interaction System** (not public repo yet), I used them to create a temporary **Bonus/Malus factor** after an Actor interaction.
-   ... Sky's the limit!

## 5. Contributing and Supporting

I've decided to make all the code I developed for my games free to use and open source.  
I am a true believer in the mindset that sharing and collaborating makes the world a better place.  
I'll be very glad if you decided to help me to follow my dream.
